The book is structured into two main sections:

1. **Tutorial on Enterprise Application Architecture**: This initial section offers a concise overview of foundational concepts in enterprise application design, setting the stage for the patterns discussed later.

2. **Pattern Catalog**: The bulk of the book is dedicated to detailing over forty patterns, each addressing specific design challenges. Key topics include layering, organizing business logic, mapping between in-memory data and relational databases, designing web-based presentations, principles of distributed design, and managing concurrency that spans transactions. citeturn0search1

Each pattern is presented with usage guidelines, implementation details, and code examples in Java or C#, complemented by UML diagrams to illustrate the concepts. While some patterns have been integrated into modern frameworks, understanding these underlying patterns remains crucial for making informed architectural decisions. citeturn0search10
